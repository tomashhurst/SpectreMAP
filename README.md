# SpectreMAP

SpectreMAP enables the analysis of high-dimensional imaging data, including data generated using Fluidigmâ€™s Hyperion Imaging Mass Cytometer (IMC). Our current workflows support a basic (using CellProfiler) or comprehensive (using Ilastik) cell and region segmentation approach, followed by cellular and spatial analysis using FlowJo or R.

### Getting started

SpectreMAP has now been directly incorporated into [Spectre](https://immunedynamics.github.io/spectre). See our spatial analysis workflows on [this page](https://immunedynamics.github.io/spectre/spatial/).
